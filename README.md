# W251 Project: Fall Detection on the Edge and in the Cloud

Tennison Yu, Stephanie Mather, Apik Zorian, and Kevin Hanna

## Introduction: 

According to the CDC, one out of five falls is a serious injury such as broken bones, hip fractures or head injuries. In fact, falls cause 95% of hip fractures and are the leading cause of brain-related trauma. Each year, 3 million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries and over 800,000 patients a year are hospitalized. In 2015, the total medical costs for falls totaled more than $50 billion in the US. Medicare and Medicaid shouldered 75% of these costs.<sup>1</sup>
